- Figure 2:
    - Population weighted (nbillionaires) count of R2 and R3 statistics
    - Pool across all observation years (2001 - 2021), subregions
    - Full sample, N>=64, and N>=64 less the top and bottom 5% (trimmed)

    - Mean billionaire wealth predictions
    - Data, Pareto, Weibull
    - Alpha hat
    - Only 2018

- Table 1:
    - Summary statistics by (sub-)region
    - R2 and R3 stats, and some simple stats
